cuda = the gpu (to train faster)
- downloaded pytorch gpu version
channels -> the colors, rgb 
loss function -> used to improve the model (goal: minimize the function)
- weights is updated by the loss function

criterion -> the loss, how wrong the model is
optimizer -> fixes the model based on the criterion

backbone -> part of the model that learns general features from the images
head -> fc, the linear layer

TRANSFER LEARNING
resnet18 -> skeleton of model were using
fc = fully connected, the very last layer which is linear, the output of what we want to predict
- using a neural network the last layer tends to be linear (like the test, connecting it to our problem)
logit = (weights * features) + bias
- model's raw opinion before convertin to probabilities
take the logits and put it into sigmoid (0 to 1)

we are only training the head to start which is the fc 

after training the head we built a function to find the best threshold (what we found: threshold(0.35)
  -> why we do this: to stabalize F1
  -> epoch 10 -> AUROC (area under the ROC curve) was still increasing so we increased the epoch to 20 
IMPORTANT: reset parameters so that you don't actually retrain the same model again
